                 Force Field Explorer -- a Java GUI for TINKER
                 ---------------------------------------------

     This subdirectory contains Force Field Explorer, which is a Java GUI
     for the TINKER package. The ffe.jar file is the main Java jar file
     with source. The supplied shared libraries, libffe.so, ffe.dll and
     libffe.jnilib are for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X systems. These
     libraries are built via the shared.make and dll.bat scripts, which
     contain the  necessary commands for the GNU gcc and other compilers.
     The ffe and ffe.bat scripts contains the typical commands to start
     the GUI. In order to run Force Field Explorer, Java 1.5 and Java3D
     must first be installed. Further information about FFE is available
     at http://dasher.wustl.edu/ffe/.
