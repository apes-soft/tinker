Dear CCL,

The latest release of the TINKER molecular modeling package, version 3.6
dated February 1998, is available from http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/ or
via anonymous ftp from dasher.wustl.edu in the /pub/tinker area.

TINKER is a modular, general package for molecular mechanics and dynamics
with some special facilities and parameter sets for peptides and proteins.
It supports AMBER-95, CHARMM, MM2, MM3, AMBER/OPLS and OPLS-AA. Some very
preliminary parameters for our TINKER polarizable multipole force field
are also included. The package contains advanced algorithms for energy
minimization, distance geometry and global search that are not, to our
knowledge, available elsewhere. TINKER is distributed with full source code,
a User's Guide, and several examples and test molecule files. Directions are
supplied for building the package on many Unix variants, Windows 95/NT and
Macintosh. Prebuilt executables limited to a maximum of 3000 atoms are also
provided for Windows 95/NT and Power Macintosh.

Please see the web site above for further information. Comments, questions
and suggestions for future improvements (yes, we are looking into a GUI...)
can be sent to ponder@dasher.wustl.edu.
