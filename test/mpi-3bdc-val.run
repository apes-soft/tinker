# Use case contributed by Richard Bradshaw.
#
# This is an equilibrated staph nuclease structure ready for NPT
# simulation, with the sidechain of residue D21 mutated with ele-lambda
# 0.5 (half switched on) and vdw-lambda 1.0 (fully switched on). You can
# change the lambda values if needs be, this is just an example.
#
# Sample output has also been provided:
#
# 3bdc.log - includes a correction to temper.f provided by Alex Albaugh
#            not included by Jay in his code contribution.
#
# 3bdc_master.log - includes sample output that does not have Alex's 
#                   correction.
#

# To debug can add lines:
#       xterm -e gdb -d ../source \

mpirun -np 1 \
       valgrind --tool=callgrind --simulate-cache=yes --log-file=valgrind3.out \
       ../bin/dynamic 3bdc.xyz -k 3bdc.key 10 2.0 1.0 4 300 1.0
