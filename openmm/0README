                    Files for OpenMM-Enabled TINKER DYNAMIC
                    ---------------------------------------

          This directory contains the files needed to build a TINKER
          DYNAMIC program using the GPU-capable OpenMM libraries. The
          files should be copied into the /source directory of a clean
          distribution of TINKER. The provided Makefile can then be
          used, after minor editing, to build a dynamic_omm.x executable.
          The Makefile assumes OpenMM 6.2.0 is present in its default
          location, /usr/local/openmm. NVIDIA CUDA must be installed on
          the target machine, as well as  a CUDA-capable graphics card.
