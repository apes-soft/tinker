# Perl to process a directory of *.txt file with the output from
# "/usr/bin/time -v" in them and return this output as a csv file.
# The input directory is specified in the outdir directory and 
# this same name is used to create the output csv file.
#
# expected output filename:
#
#  file-N-R.txt
#
# where N can be used for the number of threads or array size and
# R to indicate whether a number of runs has been used.

The script processOutput.pl concatenates the output produced by the
time command (shell intrinsic and /usr/bin/time) and outputs into a
csv file. It expects the output file to be in a subdirectory and to
have the extension "txt". The output csv file is named the same as the
directory that contains the txt files. You can specify the name of
the directory to be processed using the "-d" flag. Valid options to
the script are:

   -d Directory name - to specify the input directory name.
   -h This help message.
